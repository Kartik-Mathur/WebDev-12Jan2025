### Understanding Selectors in HTML: IDs and Classes

Selectors help us to target specific elements, allowing us to manipulate them. 

Two selectors are `id` and `class`.

#### Classes: Target Groups of Elements of course majorly for CSS and JS.
Classes are used to select multiple elements that share the same group or category. They are ideal for applying the same behavior to multiple elements on a page. 

For example, imagine we have a webpage about animals, and we want to target all the animals. We can assign a class `"animal"` to those elements:

```html
<div class="animal">Dog Says Bhau Bhau...</div>
<span class="animal">Cow Says Mooowwwwwww....</span>
```
Here, both elements belong to the group `"animal"`.

#### IDs: Target Unique Elements
An `id` is used to uniquely identify a single element.

For instance, if we have a unique element representing a boy and a girl:

```html
<div id="boy">Boy Says Hello World!</div>
<span id="girl">Girl Says I have a boyfriend!</span>
```

### Example Scenario
Letâ€™s consider a small example with both classes and IDs:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- id, class -->
    <div>Cat Says Meeowwww.....</div>
    <!-- Classes can be different and common both -->
    <div class="animal dog">Dog Says Bhau Bhau...</div>
    <span class="animal cow">Cow Says Mooowwwwwww....</span>
    
    <!-- Ids are always unique -->
    <div id="boy">Boy Says Hello World!</div>
    <span id="girl">Girl Says I have a boyfriend!</span>
</body>
</html>
```
